# How It Works

## The Cipher
The caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It was first used by Julius Caesar for his private messages.
Here's some random messages encrypted with a Caesar cipher:
- STROMBOLI -> cipher 9 -> BCAXVKXUR
- SUBFERRYMEN NATALISM -> cipher 8 -> ACJNMZZGUMV VIBITQAU
- WEEVILPROOF -> cipher 11 -> HPPGTWACZZQ
- ADYTA -> cipher 24 -> YBWRY
- OSTRACODERMI RELIABLENESS -> cipher 3 -> RVWUDFRGHUPL UHOLDEOHQHVV
- OXYTOCIC HUTCHIE -> cipher 14 -> CLMHCQWQ VIHQVWS
